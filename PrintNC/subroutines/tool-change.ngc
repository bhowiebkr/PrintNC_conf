( see: http://www.linuxcnc.org/index.php/english/forum/10-advanced-configuration/5596-manual-tool-change--tool-lengh-touch-off?start=30#48235 )

( Filename: tool-change.ngc )
( LinuxCNC Manual Tool-Change Subroutines for Milling Machines version 1.1: subroutine 1/2 )
( BEFORE USING CHANGE "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS" BELOW FOR YOUR MACHINE! )
(  )

( In the LinuxCNC .ini config file, under the [RS274NGC] section add: )
(    # change/add/use SUBROUTINE_PATH to point to the location where these tool-change subroutines are located: )
(    SUBROUTINE_PATH = macros )
(    REMAP=M6    modalgroup=6 ngc=tool-change )
(    REMAP=M600  modalgroup=6 ngc=tool-job-begin )

( and under the [EMCIO] section add: )
(    TOOL_CHANGE_AT_G30 = 0 )

( and ensure neither TOOL_CHANGE_POSITION nor TOOL_CHANGE_QUILL_UP is set. )
(  )

( In the LinuxCNC .hal config file, map some input pin to be the probe input, e.g.: )
(    net probe-z parport.0.pin-12-in => motion.probe-input )
( For multiple probe inputs, the following can be used, in this case a MESA 7i96 is controlling a NO probe, and a NC Toolsetter )
( net probe-in <= hm2_7i96.0.gpio.005.in )
( net length-in <= hm2_7i96.0.gpio.009.in_not )
( net probe-in => or2.0.in0 )
( net length-in => or2.0.in1 )
( net probe-or-length <= or2.0.out => motion.probe-input )
( The following tool change pins are required as well; )
( loadusr -W hal_manualtoolchange )
( net tool-change iocontrol.0.tool-change => hal_manualtoolchange.change )
( net tool-changed iocontrol.0.tool-changed <= hal_manualtoolchange.changed )
( net tool-number iocontrol.0.tool-prep-number => hal_manualtoolchange.number )
( net tool-prepare-loopback iocontrol.0.tool-prepare => iocontrol.0.tool-prepared )

( In your Linuxcnc.var file, ensure you have the following variables #5061, #5062, #5063 )
( They can be manually added and assigned a 0.000 to start )

( In addition I have had to modify the post-processor for the following; )
( Eliminate G43 call outs after tool changes )
( Use G53 instead of G28, typically just a check box when post processing )
( Set machine home for Z in F360 machine setup to be -.250, my machine Zero is at top of travel )

( Usage: M6 in the g-code will invoke a manual tool change with automatic tool height adjustment. )
(        M600 is used at the beginning of the first g-code file of a job so that the next M6 will measure the tool for reference )
(             instead of caluculating a tool length offset. It can also be invoked manually through the MDI before a job starts. )

( My sequence of Running; )
( 1. Use a T99, a .250" Rod, to touch off X, Y, and Z of WCS as modeled in CAM )
( 2. Manually input M600 )
( 3. Manually call an M6 T99, tool will touch off on toolsetter and store tool height )
( 4. Load program and run, M6 in program will prompt tool change, after changing, tool will touch off and Z will adjust )
( 5. Run any and all code using the same desired Z height for the WCS as designed )
( 6. For new WCS repeat from Step #1 )
(  )

( General theory of operation: touches each tool off to the tool height sensor. The first tool is used as the reference, all   )
(     subsequent tools adjust the tool offset.                                                                                 )
(     It is moved away by raising Z to _TravelZ before moving towards the switch, and when                                     )
(     moving back from the switch again moves at height _TravelZ before going straight back down to the original position. Set )
(     all necessary modes to ensure correct operation no matter what state the program is in when this is called. We eliminate )
(     almost all side effects by saving and restoring the modal state. )
(  )

( Side effects: sets G30, sets motion mode to G1. )
